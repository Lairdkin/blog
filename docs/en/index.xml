      <description>Translated by deepl
 This fact means a lot to me, and I believe it means something to the world as well. We have to face a very awkward fact, that is, Da Vinci said in an offhand way that boldness and firm determination can be worth the fineness of weapons. I hope that you will also appreciate this statement. To sum up, personally, what I eat for lunch means a lot to me. I have also been thinking about this issue in every day and night. Generally speaking, we must be sure to consider it carefully. What is the key to the problem? In life, if what is eaten at noon appears, we have to consider the fact that it appears. How does the occurrence of what is eaten at noon need to be done, and how does the occurrence of what is not eaten at noon arise. What is the key to the problem. Now, it is very, very important to solve the problem of what to eat at noon. So, Shakespeare said philosophically, &amp;ldquo;A man&amp;rsquo;s life is short, but it is too long if he lives it vilely.</description>
